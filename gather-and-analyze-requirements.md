# Gather and Analyze Requirements

Before you start designing any system, you need to clearly understand what the system is supposed to do and what qualities it should have. This process is called **gathering and analysing requirements**. Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. Talk to Stakeholders

**Stakeholders** are the people who care about or will use the system. This could be users, clients, managers, or other teams.

* **Ask questions:** What problems are they trying to solve? What do they expect from the system?
* **Listen carefully:** Sometimes, what people say they want isn’t exactly what they need. Try to understand the real problem.

**Example Questions:**

* What are the main goals of this system?
* Who will use it, and how?
* Are there any must-have features?

### 2. Write User Stories or Use Cases

A **user story** is a simple description of something a user wants to do with the system.

**Format:**\
“As a \[type of user], I want to \[do something] so that \[I get this benefit].”

**Example:**\
“As a customer, I want to reset my password so that I can access my account if I forget it.”

**Use cases** can be more detailed, describing step-by-step how users interact with the system.

### 3. List Functional Requirements

Based on your talks and user stories, write down all the **features** the system must have.

**Tips:**

* Be specific and clear.
* Use simple language.
* Prioritise: Which features are essential? Which are nice-to-have?

### 4. Identify Non-Functional Requirements

Now, think about the **qualities** the system should have.

**Ask:**

* How fast should the system be?
* How many users should it support at once?
* How secure does it need to be?
* Should it work on mobile and desktop?

Write these down as clear, measurable goals if possible.

### 5. Check for Constraints and Assumptions

**Constraints** are limits you have to work within (like budget, time, or technology choices).

**Assumptions** are things you believe to be true (like “users will have internet access”).

Write these down so everyone is aware.

### 6. Review and Confirm

* Share your requirements list with stakeholders.
* Make sure everyone agrees and nothing important is missing.
* Update the list if you learn something new.

### 7. Keep Requirements Updated

As you design and build, requirements might change. Keep your list updated and communicate changes with the team.

### Quick Checklist <a href="#quick-checklist" id="quick-checklist"></a>

* [ ] &#x20;Talked to all stakeholders
* [ ] &#x20;Wrote user stories/use cases
* [ ] &#x20;Listed all functional requirements
* [ ] &#x20;Listed all non-functional requirements
* [ ] &#x20;Noted constraints and assumptions
* [ ] &#x20;Reviewed and confirmed with everyone

### **Summary:**

Gathering and analysing requirements is like drawing a detailed map before a journey. The better your map, the smoother your trip! Take time at this stage to ask questions, listen, and write everything down clearly. This will save you a lot of trouble later in the system design process.
