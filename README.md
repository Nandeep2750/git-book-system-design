# Introduction to System Design

## **What is System Design?**

System design means planning how a technology system works behind the scenes. Imagine big apps like Netflix, WhatsApp, or Instagram - system design is about deciding how these apps handle millions of users, store data, and stay fast and reliable.

It’s not just about writing code. It’s about thinking ahead:

* How will your system handle lots of users?
* What happens if something breaks?
* How do you keep it fast and secure?

Whether you're making a simple app or a large platform like YouTube, system design helps you make smart choices about **how the system will work behind the scenes**.

This book is your step-by-step guide to learn everything, explained with real-world examples.

## **Why is System Design Important?**

* **Handles Growth:** It helps apps work smoothly even when millions use them simultaneously.
* **Keeps Apps Running:** Good design means fewer crashes and faster fixes.
* **Saves Money:** Efficient design uses resources wisely, so companies don’t waste money on servers or bandwidth.
* **Makes Updates Easy:** When the system is well-designed, adding new features or fixing bugs is simpler.
* **Protects Users:** It ensures data is safe and only the right people can access it.
