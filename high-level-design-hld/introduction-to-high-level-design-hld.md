# Introduction to High-Level Design (HLD)

Let’s move on to **High-Level Design (HLD)** and see how it works with a real-world example.

High-Level Design is about sketching the “big picture” of your system. It’s like drawing a map that shows all the main parts and how they connect, without worrying about the tiny details yet. HLD helps everyone understand how the system will work as a whole before you start building the smaller pieces.

## Steps in High-Level Design <a href="#steps-in-high-level-design" id="steps-in-high-level-design"></a>

Here’s how you approach HLD:

1. **Identify Main Components:**\
   What are the building blocks of your system? (e.g., web server, database, cache, third-party services)
2. **Define How Components Connect:**\
   How do these parts talk to each other? (e.g., APIs, message queues, direct connections)
3. **Choose Technologies:**\
   What tools or platforms will you use? (e.g., MySQL, Redis, AWS, REST API)
4. **Consider Key Requirements:**\
   How will you handle things like scaling, security, and reliability at a high level?
5. **Draw a Simple Diagram:**\
   A diagram helps everyone see the structure at a glance.

### Real-World Example: Designing a Simple URL Shortener (like bit.ly) <a href="#real-world-example-designing-a-simple-url-shortene" id="real-world-example-designing-a-simple-url-shortene"></a>

Let’s apply HLD to a system that lets users shorten long URLs and share them.

### **Step 1: Identify Main Components**

* **Web Server:** Handles user requests (create short URL, redirect to original URL).
* **Database:** Stores the mapping between short URLs and original URLs.
* **API Layer:** Allows other apps to use the service (optional).
* **Cache:** (Optional) Speeds up redirects for popular URLs.

### **Step 2: Define Connections**

* The web server receives a request to shorten a URL.
* It stores the mapping in the database.
* When someone visits the short URL, the web server looks up the original URL (possibly using the cache first).
* The user is redirected to the original URL.

### **Step 3: Choose Technologies**

* **Web Server:** Node.js, Python Flask, or Java Spring Boot
* **Database:** MySQL or MongoDB
* **Cache:** Redis (optional)

### **Step 4: Key Requirements**

* **Scalability:** Should handle lots of requests.
* **Reliability:** URLs must not get lost.
* **Performance:** Redirects should be fast.

### **Step 5: Simple Diagram**

```
text[User] 
     | 
[Web Server] 
     |   \
[Database] [Cache]
```

* A user interacts with the web server.
* The web server talks to the database and the cache.

### HLD Summary Table <a href="#hld-summary-table" id="hld-summary-table"></a>

| Component  | Role                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Web Server | Handles requests, redirects users  |
| Database   | Stores URL mappings                |
| Cache      | Speeds up popular URL lookups      |
| API Layer  | Allows integration with other apps |

### Why HLD Matters <a href="#why-hld-matters" id="why-hld-matters"></a>

* **Clarity:** Everyone understands the system’s main parts.
* **Planning:** Helps spot challenges early (e.g., scaling, bottlenecks).
* **Communication:** Makes it easy to explain your design to others.
