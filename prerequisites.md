## What You Need Before Learning System Design <a href="#what-you-need-before-learning-system-design" id="what-you-need-before-learning-system-design"></a>

Before jumping into system design, it helps to have some basic skills:

1.  **Basic Coding Skills**

    You should be comfortable writing code in at least one programming language (like JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.). Knowing how to write clean, simple code is important.
2. **Understand How the Internet Works**\
   Know the basics of how websites and apps talk to servers. For example, what happens when you open a website? What is HTTP? What is a server?
3. **Know About Databases**\
   Understand what databases are and the difference between SQL (like MySQL, PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (like MongoDB, Redis).
4. **Learn About APIs**\
   APIs are how different parts of a system talk to each other. Knowing how to build and use APIs is important.
5. **Get Some Hands-On Experience**\
   Try building small projects like a to-do app, a chat app, or a simple blog. This helps you understand how different parts of a system work together.
