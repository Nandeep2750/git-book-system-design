# Introduction to Low-Level Design (LLD)

Let’s move on to **Low-Level Design (LLD)** and see how it works with a real-world example.

Low-Level Design is about detailing the **inner workings** of your system. If High-Level Design is like drawing a map of the city, then LLD is about designing each building’s blueprint-specifying every room, door, and window. LLD helps developers understand exactly how each component will be built, how they interact at the code level, and what patterns, classes, and data structures are needed.

## Steps in Low-Level Design <a href="#steps-in-low-level-design" id="steps-in-low-level-design"></a>

Here’s how you approach LLD:

* **Break Down Functional Requirements:**\
  Analyse each feature and use case in detail.
* **Identify Classes, Interfaces, and Modules:**\
  Define the building blocks of your codebase.
* **Design Data Structures and Database Schema:**\
  Specify tables, objects, relationships, and indexes.
* **Draw Class and Sequence Diagrams:**\
  Visualise how components interact and how data flows.
* **Define Method Signatures and Interfaces:**\
  Clarify how classes communicate and what each method does.
* **Handle Error Cases and Validation:**\
  Plan for invalid input, exceptions, and edge cases.
* **Apply Design Patterns and Principles:**\
  Use best practices (like SOLID, DRY) and proven solutions.
* **Plan for Concurrency, Caching, and Transactions:**\
  Ensure performance, thread safety, and data consistency.
* **Prepare for Testing and Extensibility:**\
  Make your design easy to test and extend in the future.

## Real-World Example: LLD for a URL Shortener

Let’s apply LLD to a system that lets users shorten long URLs and share them.

* **Step 1: Break Down Requirements**\
  What happens when a user submits a URL? What if they want a custom alias?
* **Step 2: Identify Classes**\
  `UrlShortenerService`, `ShortCodeGenerator`, `UrlRepository`, `CacheService`
* **Step 3: Design Data Structures**\
  Table with `short_code`, `long_url`, `created_at`, etc.
* **Step 4: Draw Class Diagram**\
  Show how the service interacts with the repository and cache.
* **Step 5: Define Methods**\
  `shortenUrl(longUrl)`, `getLongUrl(shortCode)`, etc.
* **Step 6: Sequence Diagram**\
  Visualise the flow from user request to database and back.
* **Step 7: Error Handling**\
  What if the alias is taken? What if the URL is invalid?
* **Step 8: Apply Patterns**\
  Singleton for cache, Factory for code generation.

## LLD Summary Table

| Component           | Role                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| UrlShortenerService | Main logic for shortening and retrieving URLs |
| ShortCodeGenerator  | Generates unique short codes                  |
| UrlRepository       | Handles database operations                   |
| CacheService        | Speeds up lookups for popular URLs            |

### Why LLD Matters

* **Clarity:** Every developer knows exactly how to implement each part.
* **Quality:** Encourages reusable, testable, and maintainable code.
* **Risk Reduction:** Detailed planning reduces bugs and surprises during coding.
* **Team Alignment:** Makes collaboration and code reviews much easier.

**With LLD, you turn your system’s architecture into a detailed, actionable plan for robust, production-ready code.**
