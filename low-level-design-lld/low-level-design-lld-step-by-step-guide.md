# Low-Level Design (LLD): Step-by-Step Guide

## Step 1: Object Oriented Programming <a href="#step-1-object-oriented-programming" id="step-1-object-oriented-programming"></a>

**Key Concepts:**

* **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within one unit (class).
* **Abstraction:** Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.
* **Inheritance:** A Mechanism for a class to inherit features from another class.
* **Polymorphism:** The Ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface.
* **SOLID Principles:**
  * **S**ingle Responsibility
  * **O**pen/Closed
  * **L**iskov Substitution
  * **I**nterface Segregation
  * **D**ependency Inversion

**What does it matter?**\
OOP principles are the foundation of maintainable, extensible, and reusable code in LLD.

**What you could add:**

* Practical examples for each principle using real-world classes.

## Step 2: Design Patterns <a href="#step-2-design-patterns" id="step-2-design-patterns"></a>

**Key Concepts:**

* **Creational Patterns:**
  * _Singleton, Factory, Builder, Prototype_
  * Manage object creation mechanisms.
* **Structural Patterns:**
  * _Proxy, Bridge, Adapter, Decorator_
  * Organise relationships between entities.
* **Behavioural Patterns:**
  * _Strategy, Command, Observer, State_
  * Manage communication and responsibility between objects.

**What does it matter?**\
Design patterns provide proven solutions to common design problems, making your code more robust and flexible.

**What you could add:**

* When to use each pattern and anti-patterns to avoid.

## Step 3: Concurrency & Thread Safety <a href="#step-3-concurrency--thread-safety" id="step-3-concurrency--thread-safety"></a>

**Key Concepts:**

* **Thread Safe Injection:** Ensuring shared resources are accessed safely in multi-threaded environments.
* **Locking Mechanisms:** Use of mutexes, semaphores, and monitors to prevent race conditions.
* **Producer-Consumer:** Classic concurrency problem; managing threads that produce and consume resources.
* **Race Conditions & Synchronisation:** Techniques to avoid unpredictable behaviour from concurrent execution.

**What does it matter?**\
Concurrency is critical for scalable, high-performance systems. Thread safety prevents data corruption and hard-to-debug errors.

**What you could add:**

* Examples of deadlocks and how to avoid them.

## Step 4: UML Diagrams <a href="#step-4-uml-diagrams" id="step-4-uml-diagrams"></a>

**Key Concepts:**

* **Class Diagrams:** Show classes, attributes, methods, and relationships.
* **Sequence Diagrams:** Illustrate how objects interact in a particular scenario.
* **Activity Diagrams:** Model workflow and logic.
* **State Diagrams:** Show state transitions for objects.

**What does it matter?**\
UML diagrams make your design visual, easier to communicate, and simpler to review.

**What you could add:**

* Tools for drawing UML (e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io).

## Step 5: APIs <a href="#step-5-apis" id="step-5-apis"></a>

**Key Concepts:**

* **API Design:** RESTful endpoints, clear and consistent naming.
* **Request/Response Object Modelling:** Define data structures for communication.
* **Versioning & Extensibility:** Design APIs to support future changes.
* **Clean Code Principles:**
  * **DRY** (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself)
  * **SRP** (Single Responsibility Principle)
* **Avoiding God Classes:** Prevent any one class from doing too much.

**What does it matter?**\
Well-designed APIs are easy to use, extend, and maintain. Clean code ensures long-term project health.

**What you could add:**

* API documentation standards (Swagger/OpenAPI).

## Step 6: Common LLD Problems <a href="#step-6-common-lld-problems" id="step-6-common-lld-problems"></a>

**Practice Problems:**

1. Design a Tic-Tac-Toe or chess game
2. Design a Splitwise App
3. Design a Parking lot
4. Design an Elevator System with multiple lifts
5. Design a Notification System
6. Design a Food delivery app
7. Design a Movie ticket booking system
8. Design a URL shortener
9. Design a Logging framework
10. Design a Rate Limiter

**What does it matter?**\
Solving these problems strengthens your LLD skills and prepares you for interviews and real-world design challenges.

**What you could add:**

* Try implementing these designs and review with peers.
